# How to execute the application 

run the command "python3 api.py". This will create the flask server and then can be tested using postman

3. # Endpoints

    http://localhost:5000/api/users (Get all users in database) (GET)
    http://localhost:5000/api/users/<user_id> (Get user by ID) (GET)
    http://localhost:5000/api/users/add (Add a user to the database) (POST)
    http://localhost:5000/api/users/update (Update user record) (PUT)
    http://localhost:5000/api/users/delete/<user_id> (Delete user record) (DELETE)

# Current progress
We have been able to complete the users crud operations and got it to work without an issue.

We have not been able to complete the events managment task.

We are currently stuck in implementing the events logic which is the core logic of this project with the understanding 
that we have obtained whilst working on this project.

The crud operations for creating, reading, updating & deleting has been entirely completed and works flawlessly when performing the crud 
operational task through postman. We only faced difficulty in implementing the core logic of the project which was the events 
handling task. 

We have added all the codes we have been working on whilst implementing the events task in the project and has been commented out.
